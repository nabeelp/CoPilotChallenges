### Challenge: Code Refactoring for Readability

#### Task Description:
You are provided with an existing Python function that sorts a list using the bubble sort algorithm. Your task is to use GitHub CoPilot to refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable.

#### Existing Code:
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

#### Instructions:
1. Open your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
2. Create a new Python file named `refactored_sort.py`.
3. Use GitHub CoPilot to assist you in refactoring the `bubble_sort` function to make it more readable and maintainable.
4. Ensure that the refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original.

#### Challenge Notes:
- Focus on improving variable names, adding comments, and making the code more Pythonic.
- Consider breaking down complex expressions for better readability.

#### Additional Tips:
- Utilize CoPilot's suggestions to generate cleaner and more readable code.
- Test the refactored code with various input lists to ensure it still sorts them correctly.

#### Refactored Code (Generated with CoPilot):
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts a list using the bubble sort algorithm.

    Args:
        arr (list): The list to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list.
    """
    length = len(arr)
    for i in range(length):
        for j in range(0, length-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

#### Expected Output:
If the refactoring is done correctly, the `bubble_sort` function should still sort lists correctly, but the code will be more readable and maintainable.

#### Challenge Conclusion:
Upon completion, you will have a refactored version of the `bubble_sort` function that demonstrates how GitHub CoPilot can assist in improving code readability.
