### Challenge: Learning a new Language

#### Task Description:

You are tasked with learning the basics of Ruby programming using GitHub Copilot to assist you in completing a series of tasks.

#### Instructions:

1. Open Visual Studio Code, if not already open.
2. Create a new Ruby file named `learning_ruby.rb`.
3. Use GitHub Copilot to assist you in generating code snippets for the specified tasks.
4. Focus on completing the tasks listed below using Ruby syntax.

#### Task 1: Variables and Output
- Generate Ruby code to declare a variable named `message` and assign it the value "Hello, World!".
- Output the value of the `message` variable.

#### Task 2: String Manipulation
- Generate Ruby code to concatenate two strings: "Hello, " and "Ruby!".
- Output the resulting string.

#### Task 3: Arrays
- Generate Ruby code to create an array containing the numbers 1 to 5.
- Output the contents of the array.

#### Task 4: Conditionals
- Generate Ruby code to check if a variable `number` is greater than 10. Output a message accordingly.

#### Task 5: Loops
- Generate Ruby code to create a loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 5.

#### Challenge Notes:

- Pay attention to how GitHub Copilot suggests Ruby code snippets for the specified tasks.

#### Expected Output:

If implemented correctly, running the Ruby program should produce the desired output for each task.

#### Challenge Conclusion:

This exercise demonstrates how GitHub Copilot can assist in learning Ruby by generating code snippets for fundamental tasks. It showcases how AI assistance can be valuable for learning a new programming language.
