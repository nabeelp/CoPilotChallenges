### Challenge: Completing Partially-Completed Code in JavaScript

#### Task Description:
You are provided with a partially-completed JavaScript program that generates a list of prime numbers up to a specified limit. Your task is to use GitHub CoPilot to complete the missing parts of the code.

#### Partially-Completed Code:
```javascript
/**
 * Checks if a given number is prime or not.
 * @param {number} n - The number to check for primality.
 * @returns {boolean} - Returns true if the number is prime, false otherwise.
 */
function isPrime(n) {
    return true;
}

/**
 * Generates an array of prime numbers up to a given limit.
 * @param {number} limit - The upper limit of the range to generate primes for.
 * @returns {number[]} - An array of prime numbers up to the given limit.
 */
function generatePrimes(limit) {
    const primes = [];
    for (let i = 2; i <= limit; i++) {
        if (isPrime(i)) {
            primes.push(i);
        }
    }
    return primes;
}

console.log(generatePrimes(50));
```

#### Instructions:
1. Open Visual Studio Code, if not already open, and navigate to (prime_generator.js)[prime_generator.js].
2. Review the provided code and notice that the `isPrime` function is incomplete.
3. Use GitHub CoPilot to assist you in completing the missing parts of the `isPrime` function.
4. Ensure that the completed code generates a list of prime numbers up to the specified limit.

#### Challenge Notes:
- Pay attention to the conditions inside the `isPrime` function to accurately determine if a number is prime.
- Make sure the `generatePrimes` function correctly populates the `primes` array with prime numbers.

#### Additional Tips:
- Utilize CoPilot's suggestions to efficiently complete the missing parts of the code.
- Test the completed code with various limits to ensure it generates prime numbers correctly.

#### Expected Output:
If the missing parts of the code are completed correctly, the `generatePrimes` function should generate an array of prime numbers up to the specified limit.

#### Challenge Conclusion:
Upon completion, you will have a functioning program that generates prime numbers up to a specified limit. This exercise demonstrates how GitHub CoPilot can assist in completing partially-written code in JavaScript.
