### Solution: Generating Randomized Test Data with Faker in Python

#### Task Description:

You are tasked with generating randomized test data using the Faker library in Python. Use GitHub Copilot to assist you in generating code snippets for this task.

#### Instructions:

1. Open Visual Studio Code, if not already open.
2. Create a new Python file named `generate_test_data.py`.
3. In the Python file, either enter some guiding text at the top of the file as a comment, or press `Ctrl+I` to open CoPilot chat and enter your request there.  Text you can use could be "Generate randomized test data using the Faker library. Data require is for name, address, email, phone number, job title, company name, and description."
4. The open of using GitHub CoPilot chat will generally work better for this use case.

#### Challenge Notes:

- Pay attention to how GitHub Copilot suggests Python code snippets for generating randomized test data.

#### Expected Output:

If implemented correctly, running the Python program should generate randomized test data for the specified fields using the Faker library.

CoPilot will suggest code similar to the following:
```python
from faker import Faker

fake = Faker()

# Generate a random name
name = fake.name()

# Generate a random address
address = fake.address()

# Generate a random email
email = fake.email()

# Generate a random phone number
phone_number = fake.phone_number()

# Generate a random job title
job_title = fake.job()

# Generate a random company name
company_name = fake.company()

# Generate a random description
description = fake.text()

# Print the generated data
print("Name:", name)
print("Address:", address)
print("Email:", email)
print("Phone Number:", phone_number)
print("Job Title:", job_title)
print("Company Name:", company_name)
print("Description:", description)
```
