### Challenge: Learning D3.js with GitHub Copilot

#### Task Description:

You are tasked with learning the basics of D3.js to create a simple data visualization using GitHub Copilot to assist you in completing the task.

#### Instructions:

1. Open Visual Studio Code, if not already open, and navigate to the blank [index.html](index.html) file.
2. Use GitHub Copilot to assist you in generating code snippets for creating a basic data visualization using D3.js.
4. Focus on generating code for tasks like creating a SVG element, binding data, and creating visual elements (e.g., a bar graph).
5. Implement the generated code snippets in the provided HTML file.

#### Challenge Notes:

- Pay attention to how GitHub Copilot suggests code for using D3.js for data visualization.
- Note how the text you provide to CoPilot can influence the code snippets it generates.

#### Expected Output:

If implemented correctly, opening the HTML file in a browser should display a simple data visualization with circles based on the provided data.

#### Challenge Conclusion:

This exercise demonstrates how GitHub Copilot can assist in learning D3.js by generating code snippets for basic data visualizations. It showcases how AI assistance can be valuable for learning a new data visualization library.
