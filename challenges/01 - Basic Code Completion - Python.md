### Challenge: Basic Code Completion

#### Task Description:
Write a Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number.

#### Instructions:
1. Open your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
2. Create a new Python file named `factorial_calculator.py`.
3. Use GitHub CoPilot to assist you in completing the code.
4. Test your program with different input values to ensure it calculates the factorial correctly.

#### Starter Code:
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

# Example Usage:
# result = factorial(5)
# print(f"The factorial of 5 is: {result}")
```

#### Expected Output:
For example, if you call `factorial(5)`, the program should output:
```
The factorial of 5 is: 120
```

#### Challenge Notes:
- Remember to handle edge cases, such as when `n` is zero.
- Pay attention to the recursive nature of the factorial function.

#### Additional Tips:
- Utilize GitHub CoPilot to suggest Pythonic and efficient ways to write the code.
- Test your program with various input values to ensure it works correctly.
