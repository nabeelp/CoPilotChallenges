### Challenge: Code Refactoring for Readability

#### Task Description:
You are provided with an existing Python function that sorts a list using the bubble sort algorithm. Your task is to use GitHub CoPilot to refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable.

#### Existing Code:
```python
def bubble_sort(l):
    for a in range(len(l)): 
        for b in range(len(l)):
            if l[a]< l[b]:
                t=l[a]
                l[a]=l[b]
                l[b]=t
    return l
```

#### Instructions:
1. Navigate to the (bubble_sort.py)[bubble_sort.py] file, which contains the buuble sort function as defined above.
2. Use GitHub CoPilot to assist you in refactoring the `bubble_sort` function to make it more readable and maintainable.
3. Ensure that the refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original.
4. In the terminal, run `py bubble_sort.py` to test the function.

#### Challenge Notes:
- Focus on improving variable names, adding comments, and making the code more Pythonic.
- Consider breaking down complex expressions for better readability.

#### Additional Tips:
- Utilize CoPilot's suggestions to generate cleaner and more readable code.
- Test the refactored code with various input lists to ensure it still sorts them correctly.

#### Expected Output:
If the refactoring is done correctly, the `bubble_sort` function should still sort lists correctly, but the code will be more readable and maintainable.

#### Challenge Conclusion:
Upon completion, you will have a refactored version of the `bubble_sort` function that demonstrates how GitHub CoPilot can assist in improving code readability.
