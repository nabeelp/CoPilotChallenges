### Challenge: Basic Code Completion

#### Task Description:
Write a Python program that accepts a number from the user calculates the factorial of that number.

#### Instructions:
1. Navigate to [factorial_calculator.py](factorial_calculator.py).
1. Use GitHub CoPilot to assist you in creating and completing the code to achieve the above task.
1. Test your program with different input values to ensure it calculates the factorial correctly.

#### Expected Output:
For example, if you call `factorial(5)`, the program should output:
```
The factorial of 5 is: 120
```

#### Challenge Notes:
- Remember to handle edge cases, such as when `n` is zero.
- Pay attention to the recursive nature of the factorial function.

#### Additional Tips:
- Utilize GitHub CoPilot to suggest Pythonic and efficient ways to write the code.
- Test your program with various input values to ensure it works correctly.
