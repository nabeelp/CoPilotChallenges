# Coding Challenges

This repository contains short coding challenges in various programming languages for developers that are learning to use GitHub CoPilot.

## Background

GitHub CoPilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code. To learn more about GitHub CoPilot, visit the [official website](https://copilot.github.com/).

Using CoPilot effectively is like having a pair programmer that is always available to help you. CoPilot can help you with a variety of tasks, including:
- Generating code
- Refactoring code
- Adding new features
- Fixing bugs
- Writing tests
- Writing documentation
- And more...

As with any pair programmer, however, CoPilot is not perfect. It can make mistakes, and it can be difficult to understand what it is doing at times. It is important to remember that CoPilot is not a replacement for a human pair programmer, but rather a tool that can be used to help you write code.

To practically learn how to use CoPilot, this series of challenges will walk you through a variety of tasks that can be completed using CoPilot. Each challenge will provide a task description, instructions, and expected output. The challenges will also provide a sample solution that can be used to compare your results.
